# Spot-The-Problem
*A silly learning tool, built in Gleam + Vue + TypeScript*

## Local Development
- Recommended to use VSCode, with the official Gleam plugin as well as Vue + Tailwind CSS Intellisense + PostCSS Language Support pugins.
- To run the API, `cd api && gleam run`
- To run the front-end, `cd frontend && npm run dev`
